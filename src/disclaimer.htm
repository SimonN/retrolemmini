<p>RetroLemmini, like its predecessors, is a platform-independent Java-based engine for the game Lemmings™.
   The original game was developed by DMA Design back in 1990 and released by Psygnosis in 1991.
   DMA Design is now known as Rockstar North Limited, and is best know for the Grand Theft Auto series.
   Yes, that's right... Lemmings is the grand-daddy to Grant Theft Auto!</p>

<p>The resources included with RetroLemmini are slightly-modified from those originally part of the "<i>Lemmings for Windows 95</i>" released in 1995.
   Because of this, you need a copy of "<i>Lemmings for Windows 95</i>" to be able to legally play RetroLemmini.</p>

<p>Also included are levels from several shareware versions of Lemmings™, and custom-made sprites from jkapp76 and various other LemmingsForums.net contributors.
  (If you have contributed any graphics currently used in RetroLemmini, let me know and I will be sure to credit you here!)</p>

<p>RetroLemmini is free for all to use. Download it and share it as you wish.
   If you intend to put it as a download on your site, please make a reference to the original homepage <a href="http://lemmini.de">http://lemmini.de</a></p>
